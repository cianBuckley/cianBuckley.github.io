Hi there! Thanks for checking out my website. Here is where I plan on adding articles related to my experience as a software engineer with a 
focus on distributed systems. I'm currently working on a series of posts relating to learning distributed systems from the ground up by 
building distributed key value store on top of our own implementation of the raft consensus! Stay tuned!
