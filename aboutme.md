I'm a software engineer currently working at [Shopify](https://shopify.com), previously [NewRelic](https://newrelic.com) I love distributed systems and have spent most of my career in this area. 

Most software I write these days is a mix of Golang, Rust, Python or on the JVM, with the occasional web-app in node.js/react. I have extensive experience building infrastructure platforms and bringing them from prototypes to production reaching throughputs of millions of messages a second

I'm generally available for consulting, so please reach out and contact!
